#### What is Database ?
**Database** is a structured collection of data that is organized for easy storage, management, and retrieval. Information in a database is organized into tables, columns, and rows (in relational databases), or into documents, key-value pairs (in NoSQL databases).

#### Why use Database
- **Organized Data Storage**: Databases allow for the structured storage of data, making it easy to retrieve and manage.

- **Efficient Data Management**: Database Management Systems (DBMS) provide tools to perform operations like adding, updating, and deleting data safely.

- **Data Security and Integrity**: Databases offer security features, access control, and ensure data integrity.
Concurrency and Consistency: Multiple users can access the database simultaneously without compromising the consistency of the data.
