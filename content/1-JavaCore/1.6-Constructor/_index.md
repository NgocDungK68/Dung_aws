#### Concept of Constructor
- Constructor in Java is a special type of method used to initialize instances.
- Java Constructor is called at the time of object creation. It initializes values ​​to provide data to objects, that's why it is called constructor.

#### Two basic rules of constructor:
- The constructor name must be the same as the class name containing it.
- Constructors do not have an explicit return type.

#### Two types of constructor:
1. Default constructor
- A constructor without parameters is called the default constructor.
    ```java
    public Person {
    }
    ```

- Another example:
    ```java
    class Person {  
        public Person() {
            System.out.println("Hello");
        }  

        public static void main(String args[]) {  
        Person person = new Person();      // Output: Hello
        }  
    }
    ```

- If there is no constructor in a class, the compiler automatically creates a default constructor in that class.
- Default constructor provides default values ​​such as 0, null, (depending on the data type)... to the initialized object.

    ```java
    class Student{  
        int id;  
        String name;  
    
        void display() {
            System.out.println(id + " " + name);
        }  
    
        public static void main(String args[]) {
            Student s1=new Student3();    
            s1.display();               // Output: 0 null 
        }  
    }
    ```

2. Constructor with parameters
- A constructor that contains parameters is called a parameterized constructor.
- Parameterized constructors are used to provide different values ​​for different objects.

    ```java
    class Student {  
        int id;  
        String name;  
        
        public Student(int i,String n) {  
            id = i;  
            name = n;  
        }  
        void display() {
            System.out.println(id + " " + name);
        }  
        
        public static void main(String args[]) {  
            Student s2 = new Student4(111,"Dung");    
            s2.display();               // Output: 111 Dung
        }
    }  
    ```

#### Constructor Overloading
- **Constructor Overloading** allows a class to have more than one constructor, each with different parameters.
- The compiler distinguishes these constructors based on the number and type of parameters passed.

    ```java
    class Person {
        String name;
        int age;

        // Constructor with no parameters
        public Person() {
            this.name = "Unknown";
            this.age = 0;
        }

        // Constructor with parameters
        public Person(String name, int age) {
            this.name = name;
            this.age = age;
        }
    }
    ```

#### Keyword `This`
1. What is **this**?

- The this keyword refers to the current instance of a class. It is used to access instance variables and methods from within the class.

2. Usage of this:

- To refer to the current instance's attributes and methods.
- To differentiate between instance variables and parameters with the same name.
- To call another constructor in the same class.

    ```java
    class Person {
        String name;
        int age;

        // Constructor
        public Person(String name, int age) {
            this.name = name; // Refers to the current instance's name
            this.age = age;   // Refers to the current instance's age
        }

        // Method to display information
        public void display() {
            System.out.println("Name: " + this.name);
            System.out.println("Age: " + this.age);
        }
    }
    ```

    Calling another Constructor with **this**:
    ```java
    class Person {
        String name;
        int age;

        // Constructor with parameters
        public Person(String name, int age) {
            this.name = name;
            this.age = age;
        }

        // No-argument constructor
        public Person() {
            this("Unknown", 0); // Calls the parameterized constructor
        }
    }
    ```
#### Difference between constructor and method in java

| Constructor | Method |
| --------- | ------ |
| Constructors are used to initialize the state of an object. | Methods are used to represent the actions of an object. |
| Constructor has no return type. | Method has a return type. |
| The Java compiler generates a default constructor if you don't have any. | Method is not generated by the Java compiler. |
| The name of constructor must be the same as the class name. | Method name can be the same or different from the class name. |
