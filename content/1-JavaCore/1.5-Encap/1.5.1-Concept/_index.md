#### What is Encapsulation?
Encapsulation is one of the core principles of object-oriented programming. It involves hiding the internal state and implementation details of an object and exposing only the necessary functionality through public methods.

#### Benefits of Encapsulation:
- **Data Security**: Encapsulation protects the internal state of an object from being directly accessed or modified from outside, ensuring data integrity.
- **Modularity**: It helps in dividing the program into modular, manageable parts, making it easier to maintain and update.
