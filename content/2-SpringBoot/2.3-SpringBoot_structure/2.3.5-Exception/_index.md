#### Introduction to Exception layer
**Exception** layer in Spring Boot is responsible for handling exceptions that arise in the application.

Organizing and managing exceptions properly helps the application become stable, easy to maintain, and provides clear feedback to users and other system components.

#### Role of Exception layer
- **Consistent error handling**: **Exception** layer provides a consistent error handling mechanism, helping to manage and report errors in a controlled manner.
- **Improved user experience**: Instead of making users to receive confusing technical error messages, **Exception** layer helps create friendly and meaningful error messages.
- **Increased maintainability**: With a clear Exception layer, exceptions are managed in a single place, making it easy to test and maintain.
