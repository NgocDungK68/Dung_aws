## Concept of tight coupling and loose coupling
1. Tight Coupling

   - In Java programming, **tight-coupling** refers to relationships between classes that are too tight.

   - When using **tight-coupling**, the classes are strongly connected, and a change in one class can affect the entire system or other classes.

   - This can create unwanted dependencies and make the code difficult to maintain and extend.

2. Loose Coupling
   - **Loose-coupling** is a way to reduce dependencies between classes.
   - In **loose-coupling**, classes operate independently and relate nothing to the structure or implementation details of other classes.
   - This facilitates extension and maintenance of the source code.
